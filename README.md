# tasks-manager-async-redux

## Welcome to the tasks-manager-async-redux repository!
 This project is a task manager application:  it adds, deletes and filters tasks, displays active and completed status.

 The app is built using React and Redux Toolkit. To perform CRUD operations I used createAsyncThunk API and the backend is simulated using mockapi.io, data fetching is performed using Axios.
